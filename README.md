Each incremental hour will have a corresponding text box that is editable in order to put that ours tasks inside

There is a save button that will save what the user put in the text box, upon refresh the input will still display until completely erased and resaved.

The text box will display in different colors for future time(green), present (neutral), past (red); this will help the user identify and prioritize their task according to their time.
